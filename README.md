# Windows Scripts

Windows batch scripting could be seen as the easiest, least friction way to automate tasks in a Widows PC. I like creatting scripts for almost anything. Here I upload the scripts I create for the Windows command prompt.

This repository contains some scripts for automating some of my most used command line work flow.

This may have no use to you because they are specific to my needs.
